# Digital Accessibility Toolkit (DAT) Task Force - Terms of Reference (ToR)

## Purpose

The purpose of this task force is to collaborate on the creation of a structured platform to centralize Government of Canada (GC) information on accessibility.

The [Access Working Group (AWG)](https://a11y.canada.ca/en/about/workinggroups/awg/) would like to enable interdepartmental centralization and sharing of accessibility information produced by GC departments in a central repository and sharing space.

Sharing accessibility resources and work in a central repository would, among other benefits:

* enable GC employees better access to centralized information relating to accessibility
* create a space to collaborate between departments in the open; 
* reduce time and money spent duplicating or searching for other GC departments accessibility work; and
* promote the accessibility work that we do in the [GC on a public space](https://a11y.canada.ca/en/). 

## Key role

The Digital Accessibility Toolkit (DAT) task force supports the Public Service Accessibility Strategy [Pillar 3: Technology Make information and communications technology usable by all](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc/accessibility-strategy-public-service-technology.html).

This task force will:

1. provide recommendations for creating the GC central repository for GC created accessibility resources and work;
2. support the implementation through various phases of work; and
3. discuss and initiate supporting activities to identify which information / materials would be appropriate to shared.

The Digital Accessibility Toolkit (DAT) will leverage accessibility expertise across government, showcase best practices, and promote inclusive design and accessible by default.

The key roles will be defined based on the W3C's [ARRM Project - Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/ARRM_Project_-_Accessibility_Roles_and_Responsibilities_Mapping) project.

## Reporting structure

Co-chairs will be leaders in the accessibility community within the GC. The chair(s) may change over time as appropriate.

The DAT operates under the umbrella of the AWG and will make periodic reports to that working group.

## Mandate and decision-making authority

The Digital Accessibility Toolkit (DAT) is a recommendation-making forum that has a mandate to:

* position the GC to meet or exceed Information and Communications Technology obligations of the Accessible Canada Act and the goal of the Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service of Canada to "make information and communications technology usable by all"
* make recommendations for a GC central repository to share accessibility information created by various GC departments, minimizing duplication of work across departments
* improve consistency of accessibility and identify best practices for ICT accessibility information
* increase awareness across participating departments through the AWG and Interdepartmental ICT Working Group
* leverage expertise, foster information flow, and broaden knowledge across the GC; and
